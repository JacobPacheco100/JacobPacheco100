#### A little about myself...
My frontend dev journey began when I was 15 years old. I wanted to make some money as a kid so I looked around the Internet for ways to do just that. Something that lets me be creative I thought. I looked into graphic design and discovered a whole community of low rate freelance designers on twitter. I decided that was a good place to start. After learning the basics of photoshop, I actually offered my work for free to build a following since I didn't think my work was good enough to sell yet. To my surprise, I picked up a decent following pretty quickly, and ended up having more clients than I knew what to do with. That's when I started selling, and when it all began.

Eventually I thought of how I could turn this into a real career. Knowing that designing alone wouldn't satisfy me forever. I wanted something challenging, and I've always loved computers. long story short, I decided to start studying frontend development with Udemy and the Treehouse Techdegree. Through (this) I began building real world projects that would prove my competence in this field.

From the very first day, I fell in love with the art of code. There's just so much to learn, and that always makes it a fun and engaging experience. Design is my passion, and coding allows me to turn my design into something functional and useful. I couldn't be happier with being able to work with the two in conjunction.
